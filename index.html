    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4">Georgy Vasilyevich Chicherin, the future People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the RSFSR and the USSR, spent his childhood years in this house. His father Vasily Nikolaevich Chicherin was a professional diplomat and served in Russian missions in Brazil, Turkey, and France. After retiring in 1867, he settled in Tambov province in his ancestral estate Pokrovsky and lived there until George was five years old. Then in 1877 Vasily Nikolaevich acquired a city estate in Tambov. The wooden manor house, one-storey, with a mezzanine, was built in the style of stone architecture of the first half of the XIX century.

It was in the Guardhouse in November 1872 that George was born. This, apparently, explains why the interior of Boris Nikolaevich's Karaulsky living Room was recreated in the Green Living Room of Vasily Nikolaevich's Tambov house. In addition, it was influenced by the fact that in 1927 the furniture from the Guard was delivered to the Tambov Provincial Museum.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4" style="padding: 10px;">The desk is very deep. Its curbstones are decorated with semicircular arches supported by pairs of columns. In the center of each pedestal there are bronze wreaths with ribbons.
        Arches, columns, wreaths â€” everything repeats itself in the doors of the monumental bookcase. Empire style. The Rococo style is also supported by Berger.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4" style="padding: 10px;">George (or, as his family called him, Yura) lived in this room from 1877 to 1886. There is a memorial bronze inkwell "Duck" on the student's desk. From a young age, George was not only a polyglot (he was fluent in English, French, German and Italian), but also played the piano perfectly. The central medallion of the piano is decorated with a portrait of Mozart. The semicircle of the banquette seat somewhat resembles the shape of a curule chair.

    <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
      <p class="lead mb-4" style="padding: 10px;">George's older brother Nikolai graduated from the gymnasium with a gold medal. The commendation sheet of the pre-graduation class hangs above the Jacob-style desk. Nikolai's hobbies are evidenced by a violin hanging on the wall, as well as a chess table surrounded by two chairs. Nikolai and George often played chess.

      <p class="lead mb-4" style="padding: 10px;">Sonya was older than George, but younger than Nikolai. Like everyone else in the house, she knew several foreign languages. She studied music, played the piano and the zither.

      <p class="lead mb-4" style="padding: 10px;">There is now a grand piano in my mother's former bedroom. A bust of Mozart is next to it: shortly before his resignation, Chicherin wrote a book about Mozart, which was highly appreciated by critics.
