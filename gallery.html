              Ekaterina Khvoshchinskaya came from the ancient columnar nobility. In 1827, she married Nikolay Chicherin, a warrant officer of the Pereyaslavsky horse-jaeger regiment, a retired lieutenant. They had 8 children in marriage.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Pokrovskoe is one of the oldest estates of the Chicherin family in the Tambov region. Researchers assume that in the second half of the 18th century it belonged to Tambov governor Dementiy Chicherin. It was he who applied for introducing his family in the 6th part of the noble genealogy of the book on the Tambov province and in 1794 received a diploma for the nobility. The first truly known owner of Pokrovskoe is the son of Dementiy Chicherin - Vasily, colonel of the Preobrazhensky regiment. In 1828, Pokrovskoe passed into the possession of the heir of Vasily Dementyevich, Nikolay Chicherin. He was a very famous person in the province.</p>

The craftsmen of the 19th century decorated dishware in the same style: a white background with colorful insects, decor with voluminous blue flowers and green leaves, golden edges. As a rule, during this period, craftsmen used images of Asian or European patterns and plants.</p>

Today the bust is located in one of the rooms of the House-Museum of G.V. Chicherin, next to the monograph of the People’s Commissar Georgy Chicherin, which he dedicated to his favorite composer.

              The Soviet diplomat knew the history of music well, especially the works of Mozart, and was a good pianist himself. Chicherin thoroughly researched the era in which he lived and worked, studied the vast literature about him. All this helped him become one of the experts in the work of the Austrian musician.</p>

              The grand opening of the event took place in the old palace of San Giorgio. On the very first evening, a member of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs was granted the right to take the podium with a report.</p>

              One of those statements is included in the collection of the house-museum. The paper was donated by Georgy Nikolaev, her son.</p>
